# hello-world
My first repository :D

Hello Everyone,
My name is Justin Nikles, and I am a current student at the Templeton Honors College at Eastern University. The honors college has given me the ability to think deeply about philosophy, theology, and what it means to be human. This has really taught me how to think strategically and portray my thoughts well. I am also enrolled in Eastern's Engineering Program as a Cyber Security student. This program gives me the ability to take classes at Villanova university in addition to my classes at Eastern. By the end of the program, I will have earned a Master's in Cybersecurity. I am currently working hard at work at learning about web development. My main language is C++, as I have coding in it for about two and a half years. If you're reading this, I'd love to work with you!
